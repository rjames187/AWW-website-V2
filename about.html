                <img src="./public/doreen_and_amy.jpg" alt="Photograph of Doreen Bruton and Amy Stefanko"/>
                <p>Doreen Bruton founded Amy's Wish With Wings Charity in 2011 to give Amy Stefanko her wings. Due to complications from leukemia Amy had to learn how to speak and walk again. Amy started equine assisted services to help her recover. Amy's wish was to learn to ride independent of a lead line with side walkers and under Doreen's care and instruction she achieved her wish! Amy continues to flourish today in the program held at Ride with Pride Horsemanship School in Southlake, Texas. Amy's Wish kids compete at the Equestrian Special Olympics every Spring. We will also be compete at the Chisholm Challenge held at the Fort Worth Stock Show in January.</p>
                <h2>Healing with Horses</h2>
                <p>The success of equine assisted services is neurological and bio-physical, our brain is constantly communicating with our body. The brain is always assessing its surroundings, making adjustments and compensating. Sometimes through injury or illness, those assessment and compensation pathways are impaired or change, creating a disability. Those pathways need to be strengthened and rehabilitated.” Michigan State University Extension educators contend that equine assisted services are a viable activity that works to do just that.</p>
