I have served on a few boards of organizations that are of my own special interest and Amy’s Wish could not be dearer to my heart. I am excited to be on this board and hope that my input along with the other board members will help make Amy’s Wish more successful and increase its longevity into the future to give these and other kids the opportunities as all of our kids experience and our communities, as Amy’s Wish with Wings is open to all communities and their needs.',

Upon moving to Texas from Chicago, I wanted to learn something new, give back to a community, and embrace the Texas culture. I found Amy's Wish from a Yelp posting and the rest is history! Having experienced working in pediatric hospitals, I have witnessed first hand the impact diagnoses and disease progression make on a family. It has been rewarding and fulfilling to see the positive impact of equine therapy in the lives of our students and their families. Being a part of Amy's Wish is absolutely incredible because one can witness and contribute to students healing, growth, and development to their highest potential regardless of your background. I whole heartedly believe in our mission and hope to assist the board in providing equine therapy to all those in need and can benefit from our program.",
