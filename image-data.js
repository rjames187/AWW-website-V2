My kids took riding lessons at her barn known Ride with Pride and bought my first horse from her and she helped me choose current and past members of my horse family. I am so excited to be on the board because it is such a necessity to any child that is in need of to build self-esteem and to be included in normal activities. I have served on a few boards of organizations that are of my own special interest and Amy’s Wish could not be dearer to my heart.

My goal in life is to help as many people as I can, whether that’s teaching a therapy lesson or responding to a 911 call. Growing up I competed in 4-H and FFA showing and judging horses and cattle. I also teach at Ride With Pride horsemanship school.

I found Amy’s Wish with Wings from a Yelp posting and now ten years later Texas has become home. I had been a regular volunteer for years prior to being asked to be part of the board. My experience as a side walker was rewarding and inspirational due to the healing effect of horses. I was able to witness and contribute to riders overcoming various challenges and build strength. With a background in healthcare, nothing quite compares to the therapeutic milieu of being at the barn and working with horses. Amy’s Wish has had a lasting impact on my life, both personally and professionally. I am grateful for the opportunity to continue serving and supporting the mission!',

      'My family and I have lived in Southlake over thirty years. Born and raised in the DFW area.  Graduated from TCU with a BA and a MBA from the University of Dallas.  I owned and rode horses on the trails around Grapevine Lake. Long-time member of the Hills Church. After retiring I wanted to serve and hopefully add value to a non-profit that blesses the vulnerable.  Fortunately, I learned of Amy’s Wish With Wings and their equine assisted therapy for children to have the opportunity to ride a horse on a trail and in an arena. It’s amazing to see the joy on the children’s faces as they help brush a horse, learn to ride and give a horse a treat. What a blessing for these children to do something that every child wants to do in a little slice of paradise in Southlake. It’s also a pleasure working with the board members in advancing a wonderful program for the children and their families.  Amy’s Wish With Wings has wonderful sponsors, our sincere appreciation goes out to each family, individual, organization and business that provides funding.  Please consider contributing and/or volunteering to support Amy’s Wish With Wings.  You too will be blessed.',
